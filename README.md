## Overview

The Family Tree App lets you create, edit, import, and export family trees interactively. Users can add persons and family relationships, visualize the relationships as a graph, and adjust the layout with multiple visualization options. Authentication is handled through AWS Amplify using Google sign-in, and the app supports exporting the tree as an SVG or JSON file.
