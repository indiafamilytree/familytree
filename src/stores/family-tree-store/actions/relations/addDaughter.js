  // 2) Figure out which family we just modified. Usually, you can find it
  //    by searching for a family that includes linkedPerson (the father or mother).
  //    If you have "linkedFamilyId" in `newPerson`, you can use that directly.

  // Example: if addFamilyAndEdges assigned a `linkedFamilyId`,
  // or if your store keeps track of it:
  const family = this.families.find((f) => f.members.includes(linkedPerson.id));
